## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Patience ðŸ˜„ :smile: , working with background-images to fit mobile,ipad and desktop was hard.

### Continued development

Doing more projects that would make me put into more practice background-images, grid and flexbox.

Also can't seem to choose a either a mobile or desktop first approach.

### Useful resources

- Stackoverflow.
- W3schools.
